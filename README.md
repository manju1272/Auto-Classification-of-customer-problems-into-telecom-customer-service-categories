The project is to provide a new approach to identifying potential customers so marketing retention strategies can be developed accordingly.

Customer attrition, often called customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

Customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates are frequently used as key business metrics by telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services because retaining an existing customer is far less expensive than acquiring a new one. Companies in these industries frequently have customer service divisions that strive to re-engage defecting consumers, because recovered long-term customers are worth far more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Predictive analytics employs churn prediction models, which estimate a customer's likelihood to churn. Because these models produce a tiny prioritised list of possible defectors, they are useful at directing customer retention marketing efforts on the subset of the customer base that is most vulnerable to churn.

In this project, I intend to conduct customer survival analysis and develop a model that can forecast customer attrition. I also intend to create an app that can be used to analyse why a given customer would discontinue service and determine his or her estimated lifetime value.
